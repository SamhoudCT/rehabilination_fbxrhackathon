Rehabilination is a mixed realtiy experience that supports young hospitalized kids throughout their entire patient journey. Our goal is to increase motivation for kids' own rehabilitation.

This project is build for the Oculus Quest 2 with the help of Unity (2020.3.21f1) using both the Voice SDK and Passthrough capabilities of the Oculus Integration SDK (v34). Due to restrictions/issues with the XR Plugin Management and Passthrough not working on the alternative Legacy XR Input helpers we unfortuanately were unable to make use of the Hands SDK.
